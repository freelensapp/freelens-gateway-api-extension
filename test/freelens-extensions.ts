// Minimal stub of `@freelensapp/extensions` for unit tests.
//
// The published package is a shim that reads `Common`, `Main` and `Renderer`
// off `globalThis.FreelensExtensionApi`, which the Freelens host sets before it
// loads an extension. A Vitest process has no host, so importing the real
// package throws. `vitest.config.ts` aliases the import to this file instead.
// The package ships no mocks of its own to use in its place.
//
// Only the surface the tests exercise is stubbed here, and only at runtime: the
// tests are type-checked against the real declaration of the package. Extend it
// as the tests need more of the host API.
